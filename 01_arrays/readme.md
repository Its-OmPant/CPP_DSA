# 01 Arrays

### Problem Set

-   01: Write a program to calculate the sum of numbers stored in an array of size 10. Take array values from the user.

-   02: Write a program to calculate the average of numbers stored in an array of size 10. Take array values from the user.

-   03: Write a program to calculate the sum of all even numbers and sum of all odd numbers, which are stored in an array of size 10. Take array values from the user.

-   04: Write a program to find the greatest number stored in an array of size 10. Take array values from the user.

-   05: Write a program to sort elements of an array of size 10. Take array values from the user.

-   06: Write a program to find second largest in an array.Take array values from the user.

-   07: Write a program in C to read n number of values in an array and display it in reverse order. Take array values from the user.

-   08: Write a program in C to copy the elements of one array into another array.Take array values from the user.

-   09: Write a function to find the greatest number from the given array of any size.

-   10: Write a function to sort an array of any size.

-   11: Write a function to rotate an array by n position in d direction. The d is an indicative value for left or right. (For example, if array of size 5 is [32, 29, 40, 12, 70]; n is 2 and d is left, then the resulting array after left rotation 2 times is [40, 12, 70, 32, 29] )

-   12: Write a function to find the first occurrence of adjacent duplicate values in the array. Function has to return the value of the element.

-   13: Write a function to count a total number of duplicate elements in an array.(Means elements that occurs 2 times in an array)

-   14: Write a function to print all unique elements in an array.

-   15: Write a function to merge two arrays of the same size sorted in descending
    order.

-   16: Write a function to count the frequency of each element of an array
