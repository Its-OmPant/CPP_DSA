# 03 String Basics

### Problem Set

1.  Write a program to calculate the length of the string. (without using builtin method)

2.  Write a program to count the occurrence of a given character in a given string.

3.  Write a program to count vowels in a given string.

4.  Write a program to convert a given string into uppercase

5.  Write a program to convert a given string into lowercase

6.  Write a program to reverse a string.

7.  Write a program to count the total number of alphabets, digits and special characters in a string.

8.  Write a program to copy one string to another string.

9.  Write a program to sort a string array in ascending order.

10. Write a program to Find the Frequency of Characters.

11. Write a function to compare two strings.

12. Write a function to check whether a given string is an alphanumeric
    string or not. (Alphanumeric string must contain at least one alphabet and one digit).

13. Write a function to check whether a given string is palindrome or not.

14. Write a function to count words in a given string

15. Write a function to reverse a string word wise. (For example if the given string is “a quick brown fox” then the resulting string should be “fox brown quick a” )

16. Write a function to find the repeated character in a given string.

17. Write a program to find the number of vowels in each of the 5 strings stored in two dimensional arrays, taken from the user.

18. Write a program to sort 10 city names stored in two dimensional arrays, taken from the user.

19. Write a program to read and display a 2D array of strings in C language.

20. Write a program to search a string in the list of strings.

21. Suppose we have a list of email addresses, check whether all email addresses have ‘@’ in it. Print the odd email out.

22. Write a program to print the strings which are palindrome in the list of strings.

23. From the list of IP addresses, check whether all ip addresses are valid.

24. Given a list of words followed by two words, the task is to find the minimum distance between the given two words in the list of words. (Example : s = {“the”,”quick”,”brown”,”fox”,”quick”} word1 = “the”, word2 = “fox”, OUTPUT : 2 )

25. Write a program that asks the user to enter a username. If the username entered is one of the names in the list then the user is allowed to calculate the factorial of a number. Otherwise, an error message is displayed

26. Create an authentication system. It should be menu driven
